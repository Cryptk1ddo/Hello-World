# Hello-World
This is my very 1st repo on Git Hub, so let's see what will come out of this. 

## My philosophy
I have always been fascinated by self-development and its derivatives, so my little hobby of writing code and seeing what comes out of it will be no exception. My drive is to create top-leading apps and web environments for people who strive to get the most out of their days, months, and even years, but what's more important, out of their lives. 

# My FIXATIONS are 
**BODY**, **MIND**, **INTERNET** and **MONEY**. That's it. The rest are just intersections of the nominated.
